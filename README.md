This repository contains several notebooks and python files independent from one another that I created for my ML class.

## gps_data_attack.ipynb
This notebook uses 3 .txt files with GPS coordinates ([/gps_data](https://github.com/gabmoreira/datascience/tree/master/gps_data)) and infers patterns about the 3 individuals they belong to. This is performed with visualisation, filtering and clustering algorithms. The results show the extent to which applications can retrieve information about their clients by analyzing their location history.

## crossEntropy.ipynb
Explains and illustrates what crossEntropy is using an example taken from an MIT course.

## medicalNotebook.ipynb
Application of machine learning algorithms to medical data with the goal of studying the effects certain therapies have on disease progression.

## airfrance_hackathon.ipynb
AirFrance engine data analysis using a RNN-LSTM. The data is not provided (yet). The model needs to be updated to the most recent one: CNN-LSTM. I'll do this ASAP.

## monte_carlo.ipynb
Comprehensive guide to Monte-Carlo simulation with mathematical proofs and python code (French version).
