    "__Note to the reader:__ You should notice that initial parameters play an important role in how well the model behaves. When using HMM, you should try to have some statistical knowledge of the data beforehead so that you can use initial $A$, $B$, and $\\pi$ parameters that represent well your system. Moreover, for really long sequences the code does not work at all! This is because we are multiplying lots of probabilities which in themselves are already equal or smaller than one! So you will usually encounter [underflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34930570/at-what-point-should-i-worry-about-underflow-in-numpy-values) problems unless you use multiplicative constants in your code that take this into consideration (which I did not). This problem is stated in literature (see [2])."

    "In our examples, we only used states with discrete observations. The quantity of ice-creams was always either 1, 2 or 3. But what if this quantity was actually continuous? Like the total volume of ice-cream eaten? For this there are HMM that use [Gaussian mixtures](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.mixture.GaussianMixture.html) (modelling their observations as random variables following normal distributions). These have many applications, and are widely used by Hedge Funds, e.g. to model and predict stock market regimes [3]. Moreover, these Gaussian HMM were initially (and are still) used in speech recognition software [2].\n",
